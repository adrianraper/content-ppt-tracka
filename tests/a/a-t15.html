        <h2>Accidental delivery and other email traps</h2>
        <p>

        <b>a</b><br>
        "Whoops..." - That's the last thing you want to say after sending an email. Like a former colleague of mine at The Wall Street Journal, who nervously asked a co-worker to delete an email she mistakenly sent to her (an unlikely request to the journalist, who opened the note and learned that the sender insulted her in that note). Or an outgoing editor who sent a reporter a note - intended for the new editor - describing the employee as a "know-it-all".<br>
        Accidental delivery is only one issue that bedevils the email office culture - loss of productivity due to constant email interruption and angry email arguments are on the rise. More than one in five companies reported they had fired employees due to email misuse, according to a 2003 study of 1,100 companies. 
        And the emotional tone of emails only stands a 50-50 chance of being accurately understood by the reader, according to a joint study at New York University and the University of Chicago early this year. "The problem of email is basically two things: volume and interpretation," said Adrian Furnham, a professor of psychology and business at University College of London.
        <br><br>

        <b>b</b><br>
        "The scariest thing is just seeing people's in-boxes and the amount of effort dealing with notes as they come in - or rather failing to deal with it," said Jeremy Wagstaff, author of "Loose Wire: A Personal Guide to Making Technology Work for You." "The vast majority of people can't seem to get their email organized."<br>
        Even in the supposedly "flat" organizational structure of many technology companies, class warfare is being waged via emails, according to David Owens, a management researcher at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Owens dissected 30,000 emails of a defunct California high-tech company four years ago and found email style revealed where workers rank in the company.<br>
        Top executives tend to send terse emails that suggest "I'm too busy," Owens said. Middle managers are chronic "cc:ers," sending long, verbose emails to many recipients as an attempt to build influence in their corporate ladder climb. (They also are most likely to send emails late at night as a way of saying, "Look how late I work," he said). Lower-level employees are more likely to pass on jokes and other attachments unconnected with work as well as lace their notes with emoticons, he said.<br><br>

        <b>c</b><br>
        No matter where you sit in the corporate hierarchy, too much email appears to be bad for your brain: A study last year in Britain found that use of email, because of its constant interruptions, decreased IQ and concentration more than smoking marijuana. The survey of 1,100 people, found that the IQ scores of volunteers fell by 10 points during the day as they juggled messages and work, compared to a 4-point drop of those smoking cannabis.<br> 
        To clear up the haze created by email, Wagstaff said "you have to aim at the end of the day to make sure there is nothing in your inbox, otherwise you will always be backpedalling." Answer immediately anything that can be done in two minutes: longer than that, put in a folder categorized by project or subject matter for later response. Wagstaff thinks, a good way to assist is to create filters which automatically forward mail by subject or sender to the appropriate folder. <br><br>

        <b>d</b><br>
        Holding fire before replying can also avoid falling into a flame-out fight: "There has really been a demise of the considered response, we tend to not reply to email in a way that is conductive to business," he said. "I avoid using humor in emails; it doesn't travel well, especially British irony," said Furnham,the business psychologist. Although he receives on average 100 emails a day, he has a policy never to email anyone on his same floor, tries to send no more than 10 emails a day, only one of which can be "cc:ed" to multiple recipients. "If I haven't responded to an email in 48 hours, I delete it," he said and added "The benefits of all this are that you feel on top of what you're doing and make more of a mental space to be a proactive person than constantly reactive."
