                Six-year-old passes exams
            </h1>
            <p>
                Six months ago six-year-old Krishna Radian could not write properly and found it difficult to understand complicated words. Yesterday, he was famous after becoming the youngest person ever to pass a GCSE exam. Krishna, from Kenton in north-west London, gained a C grade in Information Systems after studying for only four hours a week at Ryder College, a private school that specialises in developing youngsters’ interest in computers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                GCSEs are normally taken by 15- or 16-year-olds after a course lasting nearly two years. Krishna took papers set by the Midland Examination Group after only five months of classes in the evenings and at weekends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Krishna said: „I needed to work only a little bit hard because the GCSE wasn’t that difficult for me.“ Dressed in a smart black suit and holding his result slip in one hand and an ice-cream in the other, he added: „I would like to go to university and study information technology, but I really want to do history GCSE as well.“
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr Ryder said the education system was at fault for not allowing pupils to develop their talents. „Society is doing our children a big disservice by running schools according to age instead of ability. I would like to see a children’s university.“ 
            </p>
            <p>
                The college has about 90 pupils, mostly younger pupils learning in advance of their years. It uses state-of-the-art computer equipment „because you can’t cheat the kids by using old technology“. 
            </p>
            <p>
                „The secret we have is that we try to motivate the children. We try to keep them interested. We encourage them as much as we can. Children can learn an awful lot at that age. If you put them in a foreign country, they will pick up the language and accent within a year or two. They can learn a tremendous amount of maths, science, computers and language.“
            </p>
            <p>
                Krishna’s mother, Nestea, a 35-year-old travel agent, said he worked well under pressure. „He absolutely loves doing it and that’s the only reason I let him. He hasn’t slept properly for two nights because he’s been so excited about getting the results.“
            </p>
            <p>
                Krishna, who will be seven in October, said he was happy to attend evening classes instead of playing with friends. We asked him if football wouldn’t be more fun. „I don’t know how to play football. But I would like to learn that and basketball. I do ice-skating and badminton and I’m quite good at them“, he said.
