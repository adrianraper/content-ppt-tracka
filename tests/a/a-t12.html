        Summer Music Festival<br>
        <br>
        Dear Mrs. Butler,<br>
        Thank you for your email about tickets for this year’s Summer Music Festival. In answer to your question, you have not yet received a ticket for next month’s opening concert because tickets are only sent out automatically to people who pay the full amount for all of the six festival concerts in advance.<br>
        <br>
        I have checked the list and found your name but no payment has been made. We would advise you to contact us with your bank details as soon as possible.  We have reserved tickets for you but, since the concerts are nearly sold out, we can only keep them for you until next Friday.<br>
        <br>
        Kind regards,<br>
        Festival Ticket Office
