            From: Sarah<br/> To: David<br/> Hi. The attached picture shows the bridge over the dry river valley I can see
            from my hotel room, though the hotel's actually a 20-minute walk uphill from the bridge.<br/> Sarah

            Did you know that fruit and vegetables have personalities? According to research carried out by Robert Sommer at the University
            of California, Davis, in 1988, lemons are seen as unfriendly, onions as stupid, and mushrooms as social climbers.
            Sommer is not alone in his fascination with the stranger corners of the human mind. Each generation, a handful
            of psychologists have explored where their mainstream colleagues fear to go. This kind of research has been called
            "quirkology" - the use of scientific methods to study irrational human behaviour.
