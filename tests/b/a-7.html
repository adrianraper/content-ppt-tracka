      Jim was sleeping peacefully in his bedroom. Jim felt very foolish, now that he knew the truth. "It's all right now, sir"
      they said smiling. "We switched off the TV for you." Thinking they were robbers, he immediately phoned the police.
      He woke up suddenly because he heard a noise. He listened carefully and thought he heard two men talking in another
      room. Two policemen arrived a few minutes later and checked the house carefully.
