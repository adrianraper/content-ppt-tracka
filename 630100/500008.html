        <h1>Making a career in music</h1>
        <p>Are you desperate to have a music career? First off, remember this - no one really knows who's going to get to the top. All those talent scouts, those so-called star-makers, are just guessing. So go into your music career knowing that there's no mystery ingredient. What you need is confidence, an appreciation of a good tune, luck and lots of charm.</p>
        <p>In a market where there's room for songs of every kind, you have a chance of selling your music. The trick is to present yourself as the only person with a particular style or talent. And why not be a bit boastful about it? Don't be shy about networking with all sorts of people - it's surprising who can help you. Start by playing your music to the owners of local music clubs.</p>
        <p>Prepare for poverty - you probably won't be partying with the stars for a while. Get a job, or even several jobs. Best of all, seek out music-related work. You can play at wedding parties, give music instruction, or write songs to advertise businesses on local radio. This way, you get that added bit of musical experience to boast about at your first audition or interview. </p>
        <p>Be professional. Take a look at your website. If it looks horrible, then it's time to rethink the design. Make it attractive, but accessible. It must be straightforward for people to find their way around the site or they'll lose interest. A record deal is no longer necessarily the first goal these days - you can build an audience online first, and then the big recording labels might take notice.</p>
        <p>Investigate all sales options. You can sell CDs through local gift shops, bookstores or a heap of other outlets. Who knows, companies in your neighbourhood may even agree to sponsor small tours or concerts you arrange. Be inventive and try your hand at playing in streets or market places, to get your music heard.</p>
        <p>Consider learning about the music business by getting a job with a music company for a while. The industry is dominated by a few major companies. Choose a record label you like and then contact the company asking if they will take you on, unpaid, for a few weeks' work experience. Ask them very nicely and be as polite as you know how. Make sure you enthuse about their music and show a deep knowledge of their artists. If they agree, that will be a step towards your goal.</p>
