<p>Tissue paper refers to the soft paper that is <u>used</u> by millions of people round the world. The problem is that in making these tissues companies have <span id="q1" class="droptarget"></span> a lot of forests.</p>

<p>Tissues are not something many of us <span id="q2" class="droptarget"></span> a great deal of time thinking about. When buying them we need to consider where the paper has come from and the <span id="q3" class="droptarget"></span> this has on forest areas. </p>

<p>A couple of years ago, most tissue <span id="q4" class="droptarget"></span> were environmentally damaging. The paper used was not <span id="q5" class="droptarget"></span> from well-managed forests. In the United Kingdom, the paper used in tissue products has often come from countries where concerns about the <span id="q6" class="droptarget"></span> are of little interest to logging companies. </p>

<p>The situation is changing. Some companies have significantly <span id="q7" class="droptarget"></span> their policies and now use paper products from well-managed forests.</p>
