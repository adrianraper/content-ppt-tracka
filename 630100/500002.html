        <p>Hi. The attached picture shows the bridge over the dry river valley I can see from my hotel room, though the hotel's actually a 20-minute walk uphill from the bridge.</p>

        <p>Did you know that fruit and vegetables have personalities? According to research carried out by Robert Sommer at the University of California, Davis, in 1988, lemons are seen as unfriendly, onions as stupid, and mushrooms as social climbers. Sommer is not alone in his fascination with the stranger corners of the human mind. Each generation, a handful of psychologists have explored where their mainstream colleagues fear to go. This kind of research has been called "quirkology" - the use of scientific methods to study irrational human behaviour. </p>
        Studying the personalities of fruit and vegetables is an example of so-called "quirkology".

        <p>John Trinkaus of the City University of New York studies ordinary people going about their everyday lives. One of his specialities is the study of minor acts of dishonesty and antisocial behaviour. In his 25 years of research, he has found that one demographical group has come to stand out above all others as being most likely to push boundaries and break rules. These are not teenagers nor football hooligans. They are women van drivers. Among other things, Trinkaus found that as many as 96 per cent of them break the speed limit, compared with 86 per cent of male offenders.</p>
        On average, men tend to break the speed limit more often than women.

        <p>When it comes to picking a partner, there are some things we all find attractive in the opposite sex. Men tend to desire women with features that suggest youth and fertility, including a thin waist and curvy hips, full lips and soft facial features. Recent studies confirm that women have strong preferences for a virile male beauty - muscular bodies and broad shoulders, either of which may indicate sexual potency and good genes. We also know that women are attracted to men who look as if they have wealth, or the ability to acquire it, and that both men and women strongly value intelligence in a mate. Preferences for these qualities - beauty, brains and financial resources - seem to be universal.</p>
        Beauty is more important than brains when it comes to picking a partner.

        <p>Jillian Clarke received the Ig Nobel Prize, an award for strange but funny science, for testing the popular belief that dropped food is safe to eat if it has spent no more than five seconds on the floor. In tests with floors deliberately contaminated with the E. coli bacteria, Clarke found that gummy bears and cookie pieces picked up the bacteria in less than five seconds, thus showing the five-second rule is a myth. However, tests on real floors at the University of Illinois, where she worked, failed simply because they had no detectable bacterial contamination - suggesting the cleaning staff might deserve their own award.</p>
        The five-second rule says you can still eat dropped food if it has spent less than five seconds on the floor.

        <p>A shift in the body clock can have profound effects on how people perform. On average, people drop six or seven points on intelligence tests if they take them at the wrong time of day for their type. "Adolescents, who are usually evening types, perform very poorly in the morning, which is the time of day that they are usually required to take their exams," says psychologist David Goldstein. For teens of whom it is uncertain that they will be accepted on a course, pass an exam or get a job, that six-point handicap could make all the difference.</p>
        Most teenagers would perform better if they could take their exams at night.
