        <h2>SEDBERGH - THE PERFECT CENTRE</h2>

        <p>
        <b>a</b><br>
        The attractive old market town of Sedbergh, with its cobbled streets and attractive Old World atmosphere, is not only set in the magnificent western dales of North Yorkshire but also close to the rugged eastern fells of the Lake District. Developed at a confluence of four valleys and four rivers where ancient trade routes merged, the town is dwarfed by some of Alfred Wainwright’s favourite fells, the mighty Howgills, and the views from all around the area are stunning.
        Sedbergh is ideally situated to enjoy the best of two of the most popular National parks in England. Located just five miles from the M6 motorway and half way between Kendal and Hawes, it is the perfect centre for those who want the best – the lakes and the fells of the Lake District and the magnificent rolling dales and hills of the Yorkshire Dales.<br><br>

        <b>b</b><br>
        A historic town, Sedbergh has been a thriving community for hundreds of years with a market dating from the 13th century. Dating from Roman times, Sedbergh still shows clear evidence of the influence of the subsequent Saxons, Vikings and Normans. The town is full of character from its cobbled main street to its historic houses, some of which still show the hallmarks of the old knitting and woollen trades which made this area such a thriving community.
        Sedbergh is also famous for its public school which is set in magnificent parkland on the edge of the town. Many of the Sedbergh School’s old pupils have left their international mark over the years, the most recent being Will Carling, captain of the redoubtable England rugby team.<br><br>

        <b>c</b><br>	
        For the serious walker there are the magnificent Howgill Hills and the Dales Way walk, while a gentle stroll along the banks of the meandering River Rawthey may suit those who prefer level ground. Along the route Kirkby Stephen is Cautley Spout, a plunging waterfall which falls some 200m down Cautley Crag to the River Rawthey. Guided walks are available during the summer.<br><br>

        <b>d</b><br>
        There is so much to see and do in this area that time quickly passes. The lovely countryside beckons whatever the time of year. There is everything from horse riding to golf, fell walking to mountain biking, caving or fishing, or even an energetic game of tennis or quiet game of bowls are all readily available.
        An interesting place to visit for the whole family is Holme Farm near Sedbergh – an open dales working farm. For railway enthusiasts, the Settle to Carlisle railway runs through Dentdale and Garsdale and a trip is a must on this most scenic of railways.<br><br>

        <b>e</b><br>
        The car parks in Sedbergh have toilets with disabled facilities and are close enough to enable visitors to walk in the town and the nearby countryside. Shops are available to stock the larder or satisfy all tastes from the antique collector to the bookworm. For a welcome break, there are plenty of places to eat and drink.<br><br>

        <b>f</b><br>  
        Accommodation is readily available in the area and ranges from traditional pubs and country inns to guest houses of character, excellent bed and breakfast houses and small hotels. There are also good local facilities for camping and caravanning.
        Information on all activities in the area and details of accommodation can be obtained from the
