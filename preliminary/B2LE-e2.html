            New archaeological discoveries show that far more dinosaur types existed than had<span id="q1" class="droptarget"></span>been believed and some were stronger and more colourful than anyone could have<span id="q2" class="droptarget"></span>.<br>
            The science magazine `Wild Nature’ published an article last week describing a creature, possibly<span id="q3" class="droptarget"></span>the Tyrannosaurus Rex, which although covered in fluffy feathers was unable to fly due to its weight. The Yutyrannus Huali is believed to have been a meat-eater who hunted in packs and, while flightless, was<span id="q4" class="droptarget"></span>of running at high speeds. This information comes from numerous fossils found over the last few years in<span id="q5" class="droptarget"></span>parts of China and these<span id="q6" class="droptarget"></span>are rocking the world of palaeontology, the name given to the study of dinosaurs.  These on-going discoveries explain why people remain fascinated by something that was<span id="q7" class="droptarget"></span>65 million years ago.<br> 
            Why did the Yutyrannus have feathers when it was clearly not for flyin<span id="q8" class="droptarget"></span>? Some scientists suggest it was for insulation when chasing their prey through the snowy hills of China, while others believe they may have been of decorative value, helping the creatures<span id="q9" class="droptarget"></span>partners for mating. Although we<span id="q9" class="droptarget"></span>to know a lot, this finding shows that when it comes to this planet’s previous inhabitants, we still have a long way to go before we see the full picture.
