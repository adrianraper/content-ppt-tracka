          Dear friends<br>
          I am very sorry that I have to tell you that I will not be able to come to our monthly meetings anymore. It is really a pity that I won't see you anymore, but the reason is a happy one. I've got a new job! I'm going to work as a secretary for a big company. The company is in London, so I'm going to move there in two weeks. At first I am going to stay at a hotel until I have found a flat or a house to rent. I'm really looking forward to my new life in London, but of course I will miss you all very much. You must come and visit me in my new home!<br>
          With best wishes,<br>
          Laura</p>
