        The Brazilian government has released new figures showing that deforestation is accelerating at record rates with huge areas of land being cleared to grow crops. This is particularly true in the Mato Grosso region where 50% of the recent deforestation occurred, as native trees are replaced with soya fields to meet demands for soya in China and Europe. Environmentalists claim that the government is neglecting the Amazon jungle in favour of increasing exports, thereby putting profit first. They are worried by the large number of highways being built to transport agricultural products, and the rise in illegal logging and cattle ranches. Officials are also being blamed for turning a blind eye to what’s happening in the hope of securing victory in local elections. Rain forests once covered 14% of the earth’s surface. Now they cover just 6%, meaning that many plant, animal and insect species are being lost forever.

        The drought currently affecting South East England may last throughout the summer and into autumn, experts say. Although there is a chance of rain this week, it is unlikely that there will be enough to refill water stocks. A hosepipe ban has been put in place in most regions in the south and about 13 million people will be affected. Many homeowners are unhappy with this ban but those who ignore it face fines of up to €1,000. The use of a hosepipe to water a garden or plants, or clean outdoor areas is now forbidden. Water companies say they regret having to impose the ban but that it is necessary to preserve essential water supplies. They are urging people to cut their water use, by taking shorter showers, using bath water to wash cars and allowing grass to grow longer than usual.

        It seems the ‘waste not, want not’ ethos popular in wartime Britain is back in trend, as crafting, the art of making things by hand, becomes one of this decade’s fastest growing industries. Sales of wool, buttons and fabrics are up and the interest in sewing, knitting and leatherwork is reflected in the many related TV shows recently introduced to our televisions. What is causing this resurgence in traditional skills? It’s a result of the financial crisis combined with our increased awareness of environmental issues and the damage that is caused by excessive waste. On a practical level, people want to save money, recycle possessions and adapt things to their own tastes. People use these skills to give their belongings more individuality. Each week sees the launch of a new website or blog on the subject, proving that people are moving away from the attitude that everything is disposable.

        The government has announced plans to introduce a new law stating that all dogs sold must be fitted with a microchip in an attempt to combat dangerous animals. A microchip is a small electronic device which can be implanted under any animal’s skin. Each chip has a unique number that can be read by a scanner. Doing so allows a vet, the police or an animal welfare organisation to find the owner’s details. There are roughly 8 million dogs in Britain. Critics of the plan say that it will do nothing to tackle the problems with pit-bulls, mastiffs and other dangerous breeds, particularly since people who own banned dogs will most likely disregard the new legislation.  The government hopes to monitor the problem by equipping animals with these devices.

        After flourishing for millions of years, the last 60 years has seen a huge decline in the country’s bee population, leading to them to become an endangered species. Experts believe that this is due to changing weather patterns, the increased use of insecticides in farming and gardening and the loss of habitat as our cities expand. Bee keepers, scientists and conservation organisations are working hard to save our bee population. Some species have already vanished from the British countryside. Albert Einstein once said that if all the bees became extinct, human society would follow within a few years.  Our interconnected eco system is dependent on these useful workers, yet many of us take the work they do for granted. Let’s hope we can quickly turn back the clock to guarantee their survival.
