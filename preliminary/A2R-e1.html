        A married couple from Eagle Lake had the Texas lotto ticket that won $49 million. Bryon and Barbara Woods won on July 30. They say they have no special plans for spending their money. They just want to pay for scholarships for some students and give it to charity organizations. Eagle Lake is about 60 miles west of Houston.

        The Town Council of Durham is thinking about a plan to change rules for students' apartments on the university campus. This plan might mean that the students have to keep their apartments clean and safe and that they might have to move out of their apartments when they make too much noise and park their cars in the wrong place.

        Teachers carried signs saying: "We're on strike" - on what was planned to be the first day of school for 11,000 students. The strike by 690 teachers was the first for schools in Maryville, about 30 miles north of Seattle. Teachers want a three-year contract with higher pay. They want 4% more money the first two years and 3% in the last year.

        A man fell 10 metres and was seriously hurt as he and his wife tried to walk up onto the 4,500 metre Grand Teton mountain after a storm brought 60 cm of snow to the top. Joe Hestick, 47, and his wife, Beth, 48, had spent two nights in a cave near the top of the mountain they were later saved by helicopter and are now in hospital.
